If you're upgrading from v0.9.6 to v0.9.7 then, as noted above, you can't simply copy
and paste the bottom chunk of code.  You'll need to insert your aliases, default bags,
and default items into the v0.9.7 code.  Hopefully this will be the last time you'll
need to do that.

If you're upgrading from v0.9.7 to v0.9.7.1 then, as noted above, you may need to update
the CSS for any UInv tables you may be using. The Table Builder in the UInv help file has
been updated to output the updated CSS.

Please keep in mind that THIS IS PRE-RELEASE CODE. This means that A) some parts
have had little or no testing, B) there are some known bugs (see below), C) the
documentation and sample code are severely lacking in many places, and also
D) some parts are still subject to change, which means future versions may not
be backwards-compatible with this version. The base code is fairly stable at
this point and will likely not change much. However, compatibility with this
version's display code will almost certainly be broken in future updates (though
hopefully not too badly broken).

In short, all of the code is currently "use at your own risk."

Currently known display bugs:
- Radial menu in wrong location in IE 11.
- Table displayed slightly wrong in iPhone and iPad devices.
- On Android/Chrome the table is displayed behind UI bar and items can't be dragged.
- Laptops with touchscreen won't drag items in Firefox (but it works in Edge).

Also, there are some "file not found" type errors if you look in the console logs.
Those errors are not actually an issue, the code just checks for the files in two
locations, and when it doesn't find one it triggers an error, but it should still
find the other copy of the file. (Though, you'll want to change
"C:/Games/Universal Inventory System/" in the JavaScript and stylesheet sections to
your local UInv directory path if you want it to display properly inside Twine.) I
plan on looking into a way to prevent that later on.

That said, if you spot any other bugs, have any suggestions or requests, or just
have questions, please let me know.  Email at: HiEv (5*9-2) at Yahoo dot com
